Borderless wallet is creating a new generation of financial services using technology to enable it.

We are building a digital wallet in which you can send, receive and hold crypto and non-crypto currencies not worring about multiple and hidden fees, commissions and surprisely exchange rates.

Our wallet is designed to hold and transfer money from crypto to non-crypto, and, also, enable you to store several currencies instantaneous, using the law of supply and demand for currency exchange rate, lightining and raiden networks (and others, like plasma project) for non-crypto low fee exhcanges, combined to a descentralized, peer-to-peer negotiation orders for faster and fairer values.
